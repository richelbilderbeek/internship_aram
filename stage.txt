The membrane is the biologic structure that separates the inside and the outside from the cell.
The cell membrane is not a static fleece. There is movement in it.
There are many proteins located in the membrane.
They are made by the ribosome, endoplasmic reticlum and Golgi apparatus.

Produced cells will then be transported to the cell membrane via a special transport tube.
When the cells arrive in the membrane, they then can perform various fuctions.
For example, they can transport substances which the membrane wouldn't let through itself.
This process is called 'facilitated diffusion'.


From DNA to proteins

DNA is the center of a membrane cell.
The first step for proteins to form from DNA is that there will be a copy created of the part of the DNA that codes the protein(mRNA).
This process is called 'transcription'.
That copy is made by RNA-polymerase, an special enzyme.
When it's done, it leaves the cell-nucleus.
After leaving; it travels to the cytoplasm, where the ribosomes are located.
The ribosomes bind themselvesto the mRNA. It then reads the message from the mRNA.
This results into a production of a chain made up of amino acids.
Transfer-RNA brings the amino acids to the ribosome.
Every 3 bases of the mRNA, a amino acid is delivered.
This will contribute to a chain of amino acids.
When the last amino acid is addded, the chain will fall and forms into an complex shape to form the protein.
