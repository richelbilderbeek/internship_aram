## Questions for supervisors

### Who is Aram?

Aram is a 15 year old scholar,
that follows Richel's programming course.

Some of his projects:

 * [Nature Zen](https://github.com/richelbilderbeek/djog_unos_2018)
 * [Tank Battalion](https://github.com/djog/djog_unos_2020)

Or how Aram would describe himself:

> Hey! So this is me. I don't know what to put here because i don't know what has been said about me already.
> Short introduction just in case,
> I'm Aram,
> 15 years old,
> Year 3 on the Montessori Vaklyceum,
> I love computers and helping others,
> I can work alone pretty well.
> 
> Any questions about me or anything, just ask

### What should I do during my slot

You can fill the time in any way you like.

Perhaps the most useful thing to do,
is to explain your work to the intern,
to verify that that you can (still) explain your scientific work to laymen.

Consider:

 * telling/showing your work
 * teaching some basic biology
 * showing some code/scripts 
 * show the lab/campus/Peregrine/etc
 * taking a walk

### A slot of 45 minutes is too long for one person

Slots can also be filled with more than one person :wink:

### Aaah! I cannot be there! What should I do?

It's fine. Just let Richel, Aram or any colleague know. 
We'll find a solution :+1:

### What is the goal of the internship?

[unure yet]To learn how working at a university is like.

### What will the intern deliver?

[To be determined]
