# Topology prediction in SARS-CoV-2 membrane proteins

Guidelines:

 * Problem:
    * We know the sequence of SARS-CoV-2
    * SARS-CoV-2 encodes some membrane proteins
    * I assume we know the topology of these
    * I know we can predict the topology from the sequence
    * Do reality and predictions match?
 * Language: formal English, avoid 'I did X to determine Y', 
   use 'Y was determined by doing X' instead
 * References:
    * No need for references if common and true knowledge (e.g. DNA contains the
      heritable material for a cell)
    * For things that may be true or false, refer the the literature
    * When in doubt, use a reference. Wikipedia is not a reference, but it does
      refer to the academic literature.   
 * Remove these guideline and comments in square brackets for the final versiom

## Introduction

[Tell what is known and why it is important]
[Tell what is missing and why it is important to add]
[Give all info needed for a reader to understand the hypothesis. When in doubt: remove]

## Hypothesis

[Modify to proper English]

 * The topology prediction by TMHMM [Sonnhammer et al., 1998; Krogh et al., 2001]
   for the SARS-CoV-2 membrane proteins matches reality
 * The topology prediction by PureseqTM [Wang et al., 2019]
   for the SARS-CoV-2 membrane proteins matches reality

## Methods

[Describe how to hypoteses are proven or disproven]

## Results

[Show the results in figures/tables/text]

## Conclusion

[Interpret the results: are the hypotheses true or false?]

## Discussion

[What are the flaws in this research? Note: 'lack of time' is not a flaw, 
an unfinished/messy story is]
